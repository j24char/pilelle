The data used for this app came from:
https://bddg.hznu.edu.cn/ddid/static/download/Interaction%20Information.csv

This is a MASSIVE csv file that couldn't be directly used, so here's how to get it into Supabase:

1. Use "csv2json.js" to convert into JSON format with keys.
    > node .\csv2json.js '.\Interaction Information.csv' interactions.json

2. Now with the data cleanly separated by JSON keys, get rid of the fields that are irrelevant using "clean_json.py".
    NOTE: This script has filenames hard-coded.
    > python .\clean_json.py

3. Now that the data is reduced to relevant fields and is in JSON format, Supabase must be set up with a table and
   correlating columns for each JSON key. Use the following SQL snippet in Supabase to generate the table:
   
   create table if not exists food_drug_interactions (
    id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
    drug_id text,
    drug_name text,
    brand_name text,
    food_herb_id text,
    food_herb_name text,
    type text,
    component text,
    note text,
    result text,
    effect text,
    conclusion text,
    reference text,
    relationship_classification text
   );

   NOTE: The column names MUST be lower case for Supabase.

4. Now that Supabase has columnns that align to the JSON keys, use "import_data.js" to upload the JSON data to Supabase:
    > node .\import_data.js

    NOTE: The Supabase service key must be copied from supabase into this script. It is not safe to store in the repo.
    NOTE: This script handles mapping of upper case keys into lower case Supabase columns.
